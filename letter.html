								<p>Dear Mayor,<br><br>
									In this letter, we will discuss the condition of Union Lake and how toxic algae has infested its waters. Algae blooms are a common phenomenon in bodies of water all around the globe. Toxic algae blooms can be detrimental to the environment, wildlife, and, in turn, the human residents of this city. In Union Lake, dangerous chemicals such as Microcystin, Anatoxin-a, and Saxitoxin have been detected at high levels. Our goal is that you will be persuaded to prevent these occurrences which bring sweeping destruction. <br><br>
									Here's what we know about blue-green algae and its effects on the marine life in the area. The algae make the water undrinkable and toxic. Being exposed to high levels of this algae can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, irritation, allergic reactions, and breathing difficulties. To cause all this destruction, the algae has to reproduce. So how does it? It reproduces asexually, which means it reproduces very fast. It can overtake the lake within a matter of months. When it reproduces the large group of algae is called an algal bloom.<br><br>
									These algal blooms, however, are not a novel occurrence; they have been detected before. Microcystin was detected at Union Lake in 2007, 2014, and 2021. Anatoxin-a and Saxitoxin were also found this year in 2021. Toxic algae blooms seem to be increasing in quantity as time goes by, and this applies to numerous other lakes impacted by the blooms. This is caused by the weather conditions in areas such as Union Lake. For example, the average max humidity recorded during the three years that saw toxic algae blooming was 90.6%, while the average max solar radiation level was 110.7 W/m2. This combination of moisture and sunlight exposure, along with the relatively warm temperatures of approximately 52 Fahrenheit, enabled the algae to maximize the energy they obtained from photosynthesis to grow. The gradual increase in solar radiation and temperatures over time would therefore also correlate to the increase in algal blooms. <br><br>
									The prevalence of sunlight and water is important towards the growth rate of plants because due to this, the plants can use the energy that they gather to perform acts of photosynthesis and ultimately develop a source of energy. The plants use radiation from the sun, water from the soil they are implanted in, as well as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to create glucose, which is essentially the most basic form of sugar, as an energy source. They use this glucose to both help perform more photosynthesis and conserve it for hard times when the environmental factors are causing sunlight and water to be scarce. <br><br>
									</p>
									
									<p>When more algae enter the proximity of infected waters, algal blooms are more likely to occur. Algae reproduces with sexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, the genetic material of only one being is necessary, thus the genes divide, and the offspring is a clone of the parent. In sexual reproduction the genetic material of two beings in necessary. The sperm from the male enters the egg of the female, so the offspring has an integrated genome of both previous beings. If the initial algae contain a certain toxin, the offspring will have that same exact genome, which is dire to the environment. For instance, one of the most detrimental toxins sometimes found present in algae, is BMAA, which has devastating effects on the brain. This could lead to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and other diseases. Estuary waters in Florida seemed to be infected with BMAA algae which caused dolphins who consumed it to stray away from home and swim up far rivers. This is how a human patient would act if they had Alzheimer&rsquo;s, with confusion and forgetfulness. This is something that could indeed occur in Lake Union&rsquo;s waters if we do not take care of the problem. <br><br>
									These toxic algal blooms are caused by both environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors that cause toxic algal blooms are the type of water, amount of sunlight, predators, and food. Genetic factors include, how they reproduce, and what kinds of genes they have. Both of these contribute to the growth and development of cyanobacteria. <br><br>
									We urge you to work on resolving this crucial problem in our community. Our proposed solution is to install a system designed to reduce how much phosphorous and nitrogen runs into rivers and lakes. This would involve conserving critical forests, fields, wetlands, and shoreline that filter nutrients and sediments before they enter the lake. In addition, your administration could enforce better fertilizer regulation and ensure that all wastewater discharge is distributed. Artificial filters could also be incorporated into lakes with the best conditions for algae growth, although special care would need to be taken to prevent harm to the local wildlife. You should be vigilant and watch out for other signs of potential algae growth in a variety of lakes around the city as well.<br><br>
									Sincerely, <br><br>
