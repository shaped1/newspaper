							<p>Recently, algal blooms have been found in Lake Union, a place the community relies on for camping, fishing, and other recreational trips. While algae can be beneficial to cleanse the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and provide oxygen, toxic algae blooms can negatively impact the world. Union Lake has been bombarded by Anatoxin-a, Microcystin, and Saxitoxin, harmful toxins.</p>
		
		<p>Algal blooms are a problem because they block the path of sunlight from hitting the organisms beneath the water. Additionally, they produce lethal toxins for humans and animals, creating a polluted and harmful environment. This could impact the food chain, and create a chain reaction of harm to valuable wildlife. Down the line, this would even translate to serious negative health impacts on humans. For example, one toxin, Microcystin, can cause liver bleeding or even liver cancer. Drowsiness, tingling, numbness, and lack of speech ability may be induced by another toxin, called Anatoxin-a. These toxins are bad news.</p>
		
		<p>Algal blooms are extremely harmful, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be slowing down. Toxic algae blooms are increasing in frequency. This problem isn&rsquo;t just happening to Union Lake; numerous lakes around the world are facing this too. This is likely caused by a variety of factors in bodies of water such as Union Lake, predominantly access to sunlight and water. The gradual increase in solar radiation and temperatures over time would therefore also correlate to the increase in algal blooms.<br>

		The above table shows the weather data recorded at Union Lake during the years when toxic blooms occurred. The humidity for all three occurrences were around 91%, and solar radiation at a relatively high average of 110.7 W/m2. As the temperature in the air was neither exceptionally hot nor cold, water temperature could be heated up by the sunlight without major interference, facilitating pragmatic conditions for efficient photosynthesis in algae (and, in turn, rapid growth/spread along the surface of the water).</p>
		
		<p>Scientists believe that ecosystem disturbance (such as the salinity and corresponding stability of water), river influence when and where algal blooms may occur, in addition to the factors of water temperature and moisture in any given location throughout the seasons.<br>
		In correlation with all these factors, human population rise also corresponds to increased toxic algal blooms. More humans require more resources in terms of food and economic growth, most probably relating to more necessity in the agricultural industry, supplying more nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers to support algae growth in lakes. Increased septic tank usage would occur as well, and, without proper systems being implemented, an even larger quantity of waste could be steadily supplied for algae growth. Climate change would be created, and waters would become warmer, enabling the algae to grow faster and absorb more sunlight. The resulting climate change would also likely induce more draughts, creating more salinity in freshwater (and, in turn, enabling marine algae to spread/bloom). More trees being cut down for the manufacturing industry and a greater quantity of animals (humans) would engender there to be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (less being processed by plants and more being exhaled by human beings), further improving the conditions for algae growth. Finally, changes in rainfall patterns and sea level rise (caused by global warming as well) would help them expand rapidly, too. <br>
		The prevalence of sunlight and water on the growth rate of plants is important because this way, the plants can use this energy to perform acts of photosynthesis to develop a source of energy. The plants use the radiation from the sun, the water from the soil they are planted in, and the carbon dioxide for the atmosphere to transform all of this into glucose, which is essentially sugar. This provides a source of energy for the plant that is used to continue this process of photosynthesis as well as save for times when sunlight and water as scarce to assist mere survival. <br>
		Now looking at what toxins were tested in Lake Union, we see that it has only been tested with the toxin of Microcystin two times in 2014 (while Anatoxin-a has entered waters a few times). We suggest that they try testing other toxins which include Alexandrian SP, in Lake Union waters to determine the after-effects and the impact that they have on the environment. For example, if they tested BMAA, they could be able to discover whether the animals in the waters seem to have brain thought process alterations and disorders such as straying away from home or family. <br>
		Cyanotoxins reproduce asexually which is detrimental to the environment. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is when the genes from two different are combined, through the sperm from the male entering the egg cell of the female. On the other hand, asexual reproduction refers to when one single individual (which in this case is a single group of toxins in algal waters) can reproduce or multiply through the splitting of genes, thus the offspring will have the exact same genome as the one causing the reproduction. Though this may seem good for the toxins, this has a dire impact on the environment since the multiplication of algae will bloom. Asexual reproduction poses a threat to the environment because algae can multiply very fast. And if there is more of a certain type of toxin, they pose a furtherly dangerous affect against the environment. For instance, if more Microcystin is present in the algae, the people living near the waters could find themselves facing symptoms of severe headaches, inability of sleep at night, and more. However, if BMAA were present in the waters, fatal affects could be applied to the brain which could eventually lead to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and other brain disorders. In addition, if the initial group of algae contains a certain type of toxin, the offspring will contain the same exact toxin as well, which negatively impacts the enviornment through further pressure of dire toxins. For example, if the commencing group of algae consists of Anatoxin-a, a secondary cyanotoxin with acute neurotoxicity which refers to toxins that damage the brain, spinal cord, and other componenets of the peripheral system, the offspring will contain Anatoxin-a which multiplies the amount of harm this toxin puts on organisms in the environment, humans, plants, and animals. <br>
		If we want to take care of our environment, we must make sure that toxins do not enter our waters and that we do whatever we can to fix any problems occurring. And if by any chance algal toxins seem to multiply, we should make sure that we block off these regional waters. This way we can preserve estuaries and other waters that are vital for our environment.<br>
